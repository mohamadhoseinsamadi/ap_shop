# Product List

The Product List screen offers an index of all available products in the store. Depending if the user is a customer or a manager, the available options for the user varies.
- Customer
  =
  The customer is able to pick products to view and add to their shopping cart in this screen.

  - Purchase Screen
  
  This screen brings an overview of the selected product, including the option to add the item to the shopping cart.

    - Shopping Cart
  
    After choosing desired items, the user can review the chosen products in the shopping cart.

    ![photo_2024-06-30_17-11-37](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/d17a33fc-fb99-4890-981e-797b68e68ca9)

    If a user wishes to remove a product from the shopping cart, they may do so by clicking on the undesired product, opening a screen reviewing the product, but this time     with the option to remove the product from the shopping cart. After doing so, the refresh button needs to be pressed so the page renews the shopping cart.

    ![photo_2024-06-30_17-11-36](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/eca205cd-eae5-4d73-8cf6-262369009edd)

    Once the customer is sure of their choice, they may choose to proceed into the checkout.

    - Checkout

    In this screen a total cost is announced, along with a final choice to finalise the purchase or not.
    
    ![photo_2024-06-30_17-11-38](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/8ea1de2c-dd4b-45d8-ad75-82268fa190e5)

    If the user has a sufficient balance, the purchase will be done, and the cost will be subtracted from the user's balance. It will give a purchase success message, and a prompt to return to the product list.
    
    ![photo_2024-06-30_17-11-39](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/813bc650-b05e-4e66-b1da-31a0d2e6c6c8)

    Alternatively, if the user's balance is not sufficient, an error is given.

  ![photo_2024-06-30_18-40-11](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/c86ec042-b09f-4df1-b6a0-6ebc67456e80)

    A successful purchase leads to the shopping cart getting emptied, however a failed purchase keeps the shopping cart so the user can try again once their balance is enough.
  - Manager
    =
    The manager cannot buy products, but instead can manage the available products, such as removing, or adding new products.
    
  ![photo_2024-06-30_17-11-18](https://github.com/iamhamidhosseini/Ghatei-Kala/assets/153517669/21cfd1d8-9ee4-4267-89cc-770b0c509800)

    - Remove Product
 
    The manager can review the details of the product, and finally can choose to remove the product in this page.

    - Add Product
